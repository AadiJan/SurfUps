Analysis for temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu
# **Overview: Proposal to Open Surf Shop**
The purpose of this project is to analyse the temperature trends for the month of June and December in Oahu. This is to decide if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# **Results:**
A total of 1700 and 1517 records were available in the month of June and December respectively. In June the average temperature was at 74.944 as compared to 71.041 in December. The standard deviation (variance in sample) was almost the same in both the months (June - 3.25 and Dec - 3.75). 

# **Summary:**
From the analysis, we can conclude that the sales in the month of June might be slightly higher than December. However, with most days (75%) having temperature around 74-77 in both the months, I belive it is sustainable to have surf and ice cream shop business year-round. More accurate business proposal can be made by analysing additional data.
